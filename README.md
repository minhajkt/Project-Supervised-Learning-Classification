# Project-Supervised-Learning-Classification

In this porject Iris dataset is directly downlaoded from sklearn.dataset.

The data contains 150 samples with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica).

The dataset is splitted to training and testing data.

A Logistic Regression model is created and trained using the training data.

Predictions are made on the test data and the models accuracy is calculated.

The trained model is also used to predict the species of different samples.
